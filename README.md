Installation of the Apache HTTP Server, PHP and MySQL




I began by updating the package list on my server using sudo apt-get update. This ensures I'm working with the latest software versions. Then, I proceeded to install Apache2 as it serves as the foundation for my web server, allowing visitors to access my website. MySQL and PHP were also installed to handle the database and script processing respectively.
